# Project Plan Overview

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - File upload interface
   - Summary review & verification UI
   - Chat interface
   - Real-time status updates

2. **Backend (Next.js API Routes)**
   - File handling & storage
   - Summary extraction
   - RAG integration
   - Chat processing

3. **Storage**
   - File storage: Vercel Blob Storage
   - Database: Vercel Postgres

4. **AI Integration**
   - O3 Mini for RAG and chat
   - DeepSeek as fallback

### Data Flow
1. **Transcription Upload**
   ```
   User -> Upload UI -> API Route -> File Storage
                                -> Database (metadata)
   ```

2. **Summary Extraction**
   ```
   Transcription -> AI Processing -> Product Detection
                               -> Casual vs. Meeting Classification
                               -> Summary Generation
   ```

3. **Summary Verification**
   ```
   Summary -> RAG Enrichment -> Market Trends
                            -> Customer Insights
                            -> Meeting References
   ```

4. **Chat Interface**
   ```
   User Query -> Context Retrieval -> RAG Processing
                                 -> Response Generation
                                 -> Reference Collection
   ```

## Technical Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- **Transcriptions:** Blob storage for files, database for metadata
- **Summaries:** Database with JSON fields for enriched data
- **Chat History:** Database with efficient indexing

### AI Model Selection
- **Primary:** O3 Mini
  - Lower hallucination rate
  - Better context handling
  - Faster response times

- **Fallback:** DeepSeek
  - More extensive training data
  - Better for edge cases
  - Higher resource requirements

### Performance Considerations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed summaries
- Use streaming for large file uploads
- Optimize RAG retrieval with vector indexing
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Security Measures
- Implement authentication
- Validate file types and sizes
- Sanitize user inputs
- Secure API endpoints
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Usage analytics
- Regular backups
- Update schedule

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics
- Custom RAG training
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with other tools
